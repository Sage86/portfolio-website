                <h2>My Story</h2>
                  <p>I come from an art background, and have been working on my creative pursuits since early childhood, over the years transitioning from traditional media to digital. My working life has been spent in front-of-house retail, service industry and admin roles. In my spare time I was occasionally selling original works of art (traditional photorealism) locally and internationally. Creativity was an advantage when it came to thinking abstractly, whereas the experience gained from interacting with the public has enabled me to approach UI Design from a more user-centric perspective.
                  </p>
                <br>
                  <p>I’ve always been attuned to how people behave - subconsciously observing micro-expressions, tone of voice etc. My curiosity in Human Psychology initially grew to such an extent that I completed a month long “Introduction to Mental Health Counselling” course at CityLit in 2019.
                  </p>
                <br>
                  <p>Losing my admin job at the start of the pandemic in 2020 gave me the pause to wonder why a portion of the world was able to WFH, another portion was unemployed, and the rest had to brave going to work masked up, at a time when vaccines were still being created, the virus was in its infancy, and deaths and infections were rising. I knew that I desperately wanted to work in the creative industry, and considered a tech career at the last minute, mainly because I didn’t see anyone who looked like me in the industry. Representation is so important. Halfway through the year, I began researching my options, taking into account factors such as cost, duration, reviews, skills taught and company reputation.
                  </p>
                <br>
                  <p>Towards the end of 2020, I secured a term time front of house admin position in education, then in January 2021, I enrolled onto Careerfoundry’s UI Design programme. It was a mammoth challenge to work full time and study part time - I had to make many sacrifices. The final module of my course is Frontend for Designers, in which I will get the opportunity to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript - resulting in showcasing my first development project from scratch!
                  </p>
                <br>
                  <p>In Spring 2022, I discovered Black Valley, thanks to a post on Reddit that linked to a Black Girls in Tech Fest London event. In June, I successfully graduated from the 8 week Cohort 7 Career Accelerator Programme. During my studies with Careerfoundry and Black Valley, I accumulated a broad depth of industry knowledge - gaining hard skills (design and frontend) through the use of project work with varying timescales, sound inspirational and supportive advice from my mentor, a stronger mental attitude as it pertains to job-hunting, and a fantastic network of professional connections.</p>
                <br>
                  <p>I’m hoping to get the opportunity to have that seat at the Design table in my first UI/UX Design role. I enjoy gathering the research, interviewing people, drafting sketches, and designing prototypes and final hi-fid screens. Also, the iterations are just a part of the process - it makes me a better UI Designer to be able to create a product that is aesthetically pleasing, easy to navigate, and solves the users’ problems.
                  </p>
