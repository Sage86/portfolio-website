                <p>I conducted the UX research and UI design for a food & drink recipe mobile app, using Figma, Adobe Xd and Prot.</p>
                <p>Through user testing and prototyping (low-hi fid), my findings were iterated into a set of clean, UX friendly hi-fid deliverables and prototype.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>Problem: Users are unable to quickly find recipes by meal category eg. breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks.</p>
                <p>Goal: is for users to be able to quickly and swiftly access specific content (breakfast, lunch, dinner etc), leading to filtered search results, with the Search button being a last resort.</p>
                <p>I analysed a selection of the most popular online recipe web apps - observing content, UI architecture, customer benefits, dropdown menu layouts, and onboarding setups. Next I sketched out some screens visualising some of the user journeys.</p>

              </div>
              <div>
                <p>I started with some exploratory sketching for how I would like to initially wander through the app, and other possible additions for users.</p>
                <p>The option of creating an avatar within a user’s account was one idea that was eventually scrapped because it started to detract from the the main purpose of the app, which is to search and find recipes.</p>
                <p>I started rapid prototyping using a series of lo-fid wireframes to a handful of test users, in order to observe and record the speed and accuracy of prompted task flows to achieve. </p>

              </div>
              <div>
                <p>After reviewing the results from a round of lo-fid user testing, I transferred some of my initial sketches into mid-fid, amending the pain points from the rapid prototyping.</p>
                <p>I wanted to ensure that there was clear contrast and white space between the background and content (text and visual). One idea that was soon scrapped was to change the imagery on catergories from image to iconography.</p>

              </div>
              <div>
                <p>Removing the bottom navigator allowed for the hamburger menu to be the main navigation button.</p>
                <p>Upon tapping the hamburger menu, the icon becomes a “close” icon to offer the user the option of closing the dropdown menu and returning to the homescreen.</p>
                <p>The UI appears cleaner - all subcategories relating to the parent category are visible. In this case: “Food > Dining > Breakfast”. A tab to toggle between food or drink is not required.</p>

              <div>
                <p>A revision of the app's contents - from a hub for all recipes, to something specific eg. teas, or baked good or sweet treats. </p>
                <p>Source a broader selection of test users, and document their experiences navigating around the app after being given a short list of tasks to complete. Analyse the feedback and make further changes to the UI/UX</p>
                <p>Design a hi-fid prototype that swapped imagery on category pages for simplistic iconography - whether as one colour i.e lobster red, or a small selection of complimentary colours i.e lobster red, black and white.</p>

                <h3>Typography</h3>
                <p>I knew that I wanted to incoporate two font styles for the app. </p>
                <p>Lobster has a lovely stylistic flair that is still legible as a header, with Raleway complimenting it with smooth round lines. My goal was for Lobster to in a sense act as the garnish for a dish - that pop of colour against a cooler palette.</p>

            <h3>Colour Palette</h3>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>With recipe apps, an initial colour choice could be green, but that colour is generally associated with health and the environment.</p>
            <p>I felt that the colour red (commonly linked to action, passion, excitement, danger) had to be a shade that didn’t appear masculine, but suggested the thrill that can come from cooking.</p>
            <p>Lobster Red was the perfect neutral red shade that worked well as an accent with the black text and white background. </p>
